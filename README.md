The `OnInit()` function is responsible for initializing the custom indicators used in the expert advisor. It attaches the custom indicator and the moving average indicator to the chart, and sets up the indicator buffers for further calculations.

The `OnCalculate()` function is called for each new bar on the chart. It calculates the values of the custom indicator and the moving average indicator for the current bar, and performs trading analysis using these indicator values.

### Detailed Description of How the Expert Advisor Works

2. If the attachment of any of the indicators fails, an error message is printed and the initialization process is considered failed.
3. The expert advisor sets up the indicator buffers using the `SetIndexBuffer()` function for further calculations.
4. For each new bar on the chart, the expert advisor calculates the values of the custom indicator and the moving average indicator using the `iCustom()` and `iMA()` functions.
5. The expert advisor performs trading analysis using these indicator values to make trading decisions. The specific trading analysis is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately based on the trading strategy desired.
